My name is Chemay Shola. 

Bioengineer turned acoustic engineer with interest in hearing aids and how to incoporate big data and the latest and greatest to help people hear. 

Recently, the democratization of AI has made it possible for anyone to get started on developing solutions with LLMs.

For example, I was able to get a small LLM running on an Oracle cloud server and access it from my iPhone completely free!
